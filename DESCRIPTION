Authors@R: person("Brian", "Fannin", email = "FanninQED@eYahoo.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package will create directories and analysis files which follow a particular analysis workflow.
The flow is meant to be modular, robust and efficient. Only those steps which must be performed are carried out. If downstream
steps depend precendents which change, the downstream steps will repeat.
